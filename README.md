### **📽️ Movie Recommendation System**  

This project is a **content-based movie recommendation system** that suggests movies based on user preferences and movie similarities. It uses machine learning techniques and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze movie metadata.  

---

## **📌 Features**  
✅ Recommend movies based on similarity to a selected movie  
✅ Uses **cosine similarity** for content-based filtering  
✅ Movie data sourced from **TMDB 5000 dataset**  
✅ Implemented using **Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NLTK**  
✅ Jupyter Notebook for easy execution

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data processing  
- **Scikit-Learn** for similarity computations  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** for text processing  
- **Streamlit** *(if applicable, for web app integration)*  

---

## **📂 Dataset**  
The project uses the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**, which includes:  
- Movie titles, overviews, genres  
- Cast, crew, and production details  
- Popularity and user ratings

## **🚀 Installation & Usage**  
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pakhi04/Movie_Recommendation_System.git
cd Movie_Recommendation_System
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook**  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open **Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb** and run the cells.

---

## **🖥️ How It Works**  
1️⃣ Load the dataset and preprocess movie data.  
2️⃣ Use **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform movie descriptions into numerical form.  
3️⃣ Compute **cosine similarity** between movies.  
4️⃣ Recommend movies based on similarity scores.  

---

## **📷 Sample Output**  
🚀 Given **"Inception"**, the system might suggest:  
- Interstellar  
- The Matrix  
- Shutter Island  
- The Prestige  
- Memento  

---

## **🛠️ Future Improvements**  
- 🔹 Hybrid approach with **collaborative filtering**  
- 🔹 Deploy as a **web app** using **Streamlit**  
- 🔹 Improve recommendations using **deep learning**
